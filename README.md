# Fight-One

This is a simple, free to use template.

It is a text based figthing game where the player can choose from 4 moves that will either attack or defend themself from the enemy: Beezlebub.

This implements cooldowns, blocking, and effects like burning.

Made and run using Eclipse, and you can find the file through FightProject --> src --> pack --> Fight1.java

Next Steps:
- Implement Thread.sleep() so the user isn't bombarded with too much information
- Format the text in the proper way (for each cycle)
- Tweak the damage of attacks so that Beezlebub isn't overpowered
